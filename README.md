**RadioHost.cloud Studio** is a modern, web-based application for internet radio automation, designed to help broadcasters schedule, manage, and create content effortlessly.

## Core Concept

The application is built on a client-server architecture. The React-based frontend connects to a dedicated Node.js backend server, which is designed for collaborative, multi-user environments. This enables a central shared media library, real-time playlist synchronization, and remote presenter capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéõÔ∏è Advanced Audio Engine & Mixer
*   **Multi-Channel Mixer:** Control volume, mute, and routing for the Main Player, Microphone, Cartwall, and Remote Presenters.
*   **Multiple Output Buses:** Separate "Main" (on-air) and "Monitor/PFL" outputs with physical device selection.
*   **Auto-Ducking:** Automatically lowers music volume when the microphone or a cart is active.
*   **Master Processing:** Built-in Compressor (Normalization) and a 3-band Equalizer with presets for master output shaping.
*   **Live Metering:** Real-time audio level meters for all sources and buses.

### üéº Smart Timeline & Playlist
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Easily build and reorder your show's timeline.
*   **Auto-Fill (Dead Air Protection):** Automatically adds tracks from a specified folder or tag to prevent silence when the playlist runs out.
*   **Time Markers (Hard & Soft):** Schedule precise transitions, forcing playback to jump to a specific item at an exact time (Hard) or after the current track finishes (Soft).
*   **Voice Track Editor:** A powerful in-line editor to record and mix voice-overs directly between tracks, with adjustable timing, fades, and audio trimming.

### üì° Live Streaming & Collaboration
*   **Remote Presenter Mode (WebRTC):** Invite co-hosts to connect to the studio from anywhere. Their microphone audio is streamed directly into a dedicated mixer channel.
*   **Public Streaming:** Broadcast your main output directly from the browser to a public URL. The system provides a shareable, mobile-friendly player page for listeners.
*   **Live Listener Chat:** Engage with your audience in real-time through a chat widget on the public player page.
*   **Live Stats:** View a list of current listeners connected to your public stream.

### üóÇÔ∏è Media Library
*   **Central Storage:** Upload files to a central server for a shared media library.
*   **Organization:** Use folders and tags to categorize all assets. Tagging a folder applies tags to all its contents.
*   **Advanced Import:** Upload individual files or import an entire folder structure from your computer.
*   **Metadata & Artwork:** Automatic ID3 tag parsing and artwork fetching from the iTunes API.
*   **PFL (Pre-Fade Listen):** Preview tracks in the library through the monitor output without going on air.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Scheduling & Management
*   **Broadcast Scheduler:** Plan shows in advance. Create broadcasts with specific start times, repeatable schedules (daily, weekly, monthly), and a dedicated playlist. Broadcasts are automatically loaded into the timeline when they are scheduled to start.
*   **User Management:** Assign roles to users, designating them as "Studio" operators with full control or "Presenters" with remote access.
*   **Data Management:** Export your entire setup (library, playlists, settings) to a single JSON file for backup or migration.
*   **Automatic Backups:** Configure the app to automatically save backup files to a local folder at a set interval or on startup.

### üì± User Interface & Experience
*   **Resizable Layout:** Fully customizable interface where you can drag to resize all columns and the main header.
*   **Dual Header Views:** A compact header for maximum screen real estate, which expands into a multi-deck view showing "Now Playing," "Next," and "Up Next" with large artwork.
*   **Cartwall:** An instant-playback grid for jingles, sound effects, and ads with multiple customizable pages.
*   **Last.fm Integration:** View artist bios, similar artists, and track information for the currently playing song.
*   **Mobile UI:** A dedicated, touch-friendly interface for presenters, allowing them to go live and record voice tracks from their mobile devices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the application, you need to set up and run the provided backend server.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Backend Server Setup

The backend server handles user accounts, data, and file storage.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/radiohost-cloud/radiohost.cloud.git
    cd radiohost.cloud
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default. It will create a `db.json` file for data and `Media/` and `Artwork/` folders for uploaded files in the project root.

#### Frontend Setup

1.  **Run the frontend development server (in a new terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    *   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite specifies).
    *   The app will prompt you to log in or sign up, making API calls to your local backend server running on port 3000.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React 19
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Multer, LowDB
*   **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets, WebRTC
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Local Config Storage:** IndexedDB (via `idb` library)
*   **Audio:** Web Audio API
